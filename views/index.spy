							Hey, my name is RÃ©mi or you can call me Whassa. I'm currently studying in Software Engineering at <a href="https://www.etsmtl.ca/">ETS</a>
							in Montreal. This is a small Website portfolio I've created for you to discover some of my projects. 
							I'm a full stack developper who has specialized in ReactJs and NextJs. I also know a lot of web language such as Ruby, PHP and Python.
							I'm a curious person and I always like to know for more. 
							Also, there's a link to my github pages in the menu if you're more interested to know more about what I'm doing!
