# portfolio
This is a small node server that I will be hosting that act as a portfolio. I also made a small game in javascript called project Target.

To start the project simply copy the github project then do those command. You'll need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/).


```bash
npm install
npm run css-build
node app.js
```
